# HPWHsim

An open source simulation model for Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWH).

HPWHsim was developed with whole house simulation in mind; it is intended to be run independently of the overarching simulation's time steps, other parameters, and does not aggregate its own outputs. It was also designed to run quickly, as the typical use case would see many simulations run, each a year-long or more.
